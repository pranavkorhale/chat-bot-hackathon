============================================
Indianapolis Curfew Policy (2024)
============================================

Under Indiana State Law:

Youth under 15 years:
- Prohibited in public between 11:00 PM and 5:00 AM any day.

Teens aged 15â€“17 years:
- Saturday & Sunday: Not allowed between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM.
- Sunday to Thursday: Not allowed after 11:00 PM until 5:00 AM.
- Friday night: Not allowed before 5:00 AM Saturday.

Exceptions:
- Accompanied by parent, guardian, or adult designated by parent.
- Traveling to/from work, school, church, or supervised event.
- In an emergency or exercising freedom of speech/assembly.
- Traveling outside of Indiana.

Enforcement:
- Violations are non-criminal ("status offenses").
- IMPD uses PA announcements 30 & 15 minutes before curfew and at curfew.
- Minors may be taken to safe locations; guardians notified; temporary custody if needed.

Impact:
- Enforcement began April 2024 in response to youth gun violence.
- Only three adolescents formally detained for curfew violations between April and August 2024.
- Informal dispersals untracked, raising questions about overall effectiveness and equity.
